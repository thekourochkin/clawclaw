## 📈 Marketing Psychology Applied

### Principle: Social Proof
**Implementation**: Company logos, user count (5,000+), testimonials, 5-star ratings
**Why it works**: People follow the crowd. If 5,000 users trust us, new users will too.

### Principle: Authority
**Implementation**: Compliance badges (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2), industry-specific success stories
**Why it works**: Certifications = credibility. Healthcare/Legal stories = expertise.

### Principle: Specificity
**Implementation**: "87% faster" not "much faster", "$12K savings" not "save money"
**Why it works**: Specific numbers are believable. Vague claims sound like marketing BS.

### Principle: Objection Handling
**Implementation**: 8-question FAQ covering all major concerns
**Why it works**: Removes friction. Users don't have to contact sales to get answers.

### Principle: Reciprocity
**Implementation**: Free tier, free trial, money-back guarantee
**Why it works**: We give first (free value), users feel obligated to give back (conversion).

### Principle: Relatability
**Implementation**: 6 different persona testimonials (CTO, Doctor, Indie Hacker, etc.)
**Why it works**: Users see themselves in the stories. "If it worked for them, it'll work for me."
